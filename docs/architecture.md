# Architecture

## System Concept

This is a prompt-driven strategy factory.

```text
Prompt
  → LLM-generated strategy config
  → validated YAML/JSON
  → backtest
  → approval
  → monthly portfolio ranking
  → intraday monitoring
  → risk validation
  → Alpaca order execution
```

## Core Boundary

```text
LLM = config, interpretation, explanation
Python = deterministic engine
Risk service = hard safety gate
Trade executor = only service allowed to place orders
```

The LLM may propose and explain strategy behavior. It must not directly trade.

## Service Groups

### Stateful Infrastructure

```text
postgres
redis
artifacts volume
```

### Research and Ranking

```text
av-ingestor
factor-engine
ranker
portfolio-builder
backtester
evaluator
```

### Trading and Monitoring

```text
alpaca-sync
intraday-monitor
risk-service
trade-executor
```

### LLM and Strategy Configuration

```text
llm-gateway
strategy-config-service
strategy-validator
strategy-registry
```

### User Interface and Operations

```text
api
dashboard
scheduler
```

## Data Flow

```text
Alpha Vantage
  → av-ingestor
  → Postgres
  → factor-engine
  → ranker
  → portfolio-builder
  → target portfolio

Alpaca
  → alpaca-sync
  → Postgres

Alpaca real-time data
  → intraday-monitor
  → signal
  → risk-service
  → trade-executor
  → Alpaca order
```

## Strategy Flow

```text
User prompt
  → llm-gateway
  → strategy-config-service
  → YAML/JSON config
  → strategy-validator
  → backtester
  → evaluator
  → approval
  → active strategy registry
```

## State Rule

App services should be stateless. Durable state belongs in Postgres, Redis, and versioned files.
